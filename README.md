# Test-Aware Low-Power Clock Gating in DSP Blocks  

---

## Project Overview
This project presents the **design, synthesis, verification, and testability enhancement** of a **7-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter** with **test-aware low-power clock gating**. The goal is to reduce dynamic power consumption while preserving **100% fault coverage** using scan-based testing.

The complete ASIC design methodology is followed:
- RTL design in Verilog  
- Functional verification in ModelSim  
- Synthesis using Synopsys Design Compiler  
- Scan insertion using Synopsys DFT tools  
- ATPG and fault simulation using Synopsys TetraMAX  
- Post-synthesis simulation  
- Area, power, timing, and fault coverage analysis

## Objectives
- Implement a low-power DSP block (FIR filter) using **clock gating**.  
- Ensure **full scan-based testability** using test-mode override.  
- Achieve high performance while minimizing area and power.  
- Validate design using industry-standard EDA tools.

## Key Features
### 7-tap FIR Filter Architecture  
- Fully synchronous pipeline  
- 8-bit inputs, expanded output  
- Symmetric MAC structure for hardware efficiency  

### Test-Aware Clock Gating  
- Gated clock disables inactive datapath  
- Overrides clock gating during **test_mode = 1**  
- Enables controllability/observability during scan testing  

### ASIC Flow Implementation  
- RTL → Synthesis → DFT → ATPG → Verification  
- Uses **Nangate 45 nm Open Cell Library**

### 100% Fault Coverage  
- ATPG using TetraMAX  
- Detected all 922 faults  
- Only 9 test patterns required
